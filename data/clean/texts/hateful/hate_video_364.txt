 I want to be the very best. What happened? You got to catch them all, you know? Oh, Okie-Mongo. Don't you have anything better to be doing with your time? No, not really. What if I told you that I had a game that was way more fun and you would be helping to make the world a better place? No, it sounds good, I'm game. It's going to the warehouse where I keep the prototypes. Whoa, cool place. We're remodeling. So, here you are. These are our new prototype glasses. Just put these on and you'll be able to see them. No, go necessary. Awesome. Alright, let's hit the streets. I know a place where they congregate. Oh, what the hell's that smell? It's going to fail to fish. One of them must be close. Who tells it? That's one of them. That's a pinoge. How do I catch it? Take this black bag, put it over its head and shove it into the white band that's about to pull up. I got him, I got him. Get the fan pinoge. That all felt so realistic, but how is this helping to make the world a better place? Well, every little bit helps. We got to catch him all you know. Just go home tonight and watch the 6 o'clock news and maybe you'll see what I get you. Alright, cool. That actually is great gaming glasses. I really appreciate it. A famous Hollywood actor and producer has gone missing today. Police searched his place today for clues to his whereabouts, but were only able to turn up lots of child porn and snuff films, which were probably just placed there by some awful anti-semite or something. Who cares anyways? Stop being a bigot. Police have interviewed witnesses who say that they last saw him being shoved into a van by some bearded man wearing bano glasses. The investigation is ongoing. Up next, why Israel is our greatest ally in the only democracy in the Middle East.
